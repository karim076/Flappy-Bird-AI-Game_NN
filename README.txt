## introduction 
In this project i am making a flappy bird game where a neural network is training it selfs, each generation gets better.<br>
Each generation starts with 60 flappy birds at a time(this is customizable but limited for low-end pc/laptop)💻 
## 🐦 how to run 🐦
To run this code we use the Command terminal-?<br>
- open command line<br>
- path to directory of the game.cs so somthing like -> cd c:Karim/game<br>
- now you run the game by typing the fullname of the game 'game.py'<br>
The game should start flapping its way around 😉<br>
